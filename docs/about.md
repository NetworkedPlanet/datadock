DataDock is a web application and proxy service that makes it easy to create
and publish Linked Open Data.

The web application takes CSV data and makes it linkable by converting it into RDF. Your data 
is hosted in a GitHub repository of your choosing and is available to your end users both in
its original CSV format and in the converted RDF format. 

The proxy service provides a way for your linked data to be served up from the datadock.io domain.
Our proxy server takes care of redirects that ensure applications retrieve linked data and users
see clean, formatted HTML pages.

We provide all of this as a free-to-use service in an effort to encourage more data creators and 
data publishers to consider fully joining the Web of Data.

If you would like to know more about what we do, or to talk to us about providing a similar service
to run inside your organisation please [get in touch](http://networkedplanet.com/contact/).
