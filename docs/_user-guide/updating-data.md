In the current release of DataDock, all datasets are uniquely identified using
the file name of the CSV file that was uploaded. To update an existing dataset, simply create
a CSV file with the same name as the original CSV file (you can see this in the dataset identifier
displayed in the Dataset List on your Dashboard) and follow the normal procedure for [Adding Data](./adding-data.html).

A dataset is updated by removing all of the data from the old version of the dataset; then converting and importing
all data from the newly uploaded CSV. This approach means that when you wish to update an existing 
dataset you must ensure that the new CSV file contains the complete set of data you want to publish, not
just new additions.

We plan to provide more update features in future releases of the tool. Watch this space, or [get in touch](./getting-help.html)
to let us know your thoughts or requirements for an update procedure.
