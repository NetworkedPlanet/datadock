In order to utilise the full potential of the Web of Data, each column of data is defined using URIs rather than plain text. DataDock automatically generates these URIs based on the column headings from your source data file.

On the advanced tab during the import process, you can change these URIs to other values and make use of your own organisation's vocabularies, taxonomies, ontologies and/or data models, or your can make use of those published by others as Linked Open Data (LOD) vocabularies. 
 
Choosing or creating your own Linked Open Data vocabulary forms part of your wider data publishing strategy, at Networked Planet we can provide consultancy and training to help you publish your data using the best practise guidelines and standards of the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).

If you are comfortable with the concept of LOD vocabularies, you can edit these in the Advanced tab, if not you can simply leave the automatically generated URIs in place. If you change the URI and wish to go back to using the auto-generated URI, there is a reset button to the right of the URI textbox.
