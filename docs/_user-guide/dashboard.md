The dashboard is where you can navigate around your GitHub account and organisation's repositories. 

## Summary
 
The summary page shows the 5 most recent datasets, and 5 most recent jobs, along with links to lists of all datasets and all jobs for that context.

## Menu 

### Context

By default the dashboard shows the context of your user's summary, but you can also change the dashboard context to show you the summary of any GitHub organisation you have access to*, or change the context to "everything" to show all.

The menu shows a drop down list of all the contexts you have access to. If an organisation you have access to is not listed here, you may need to [update DataDock's access permissions](https://github.com/settings/applications) or get the organization's owner to do so, and then log out from DataDock and log back in again.
 
## Repositories

The repository list drop down shows repositories that you have *already published data to*. Choosing one of the repositories changes the dashboard context to that repository. 

If you do not already have datasets published to a repository, choose the owner's context (i.e. either your profile or an organisation's profile) and use the `Add Data` button select which repository you would like to publish data to.

## Add Data

Depending on which context you are viewing the dashboard as, the Add Data button will either show you all repositories you have access to (the "Everything" level context), all repositories for the selected profile or organisation, or take you directly to the file selection if you have already navigated to a particular repository in the dashboard.

For more information, read the [Adding Data](/user-guide/adding-data.html) documentation.

## Datasets

Displays all datasets published to that context. Scrolling down the page loads the next 5 datasets at a time. 

## Job History

Displays all job histories relevant to that context. Scrolling down the page loads the next 5 jobs at a time.

## Settings

Add the publisher details for a particular context. It is recommended that you set the publisher at an owner level (i.e. the user profile / organization) at a minimum, and set the publisher at a repository level if you deem it necessary (e.g. you are publishing data on behalf of different publishers for different repositories).
