# Logging In And Out

Access to your Linked Data Laboratory account is authenticated using your GitHub login. You must be logged in to your GitHub account
in order to access the protected areas of the Linked Data Laboratory - this includes access to your Dashboard and to upload new datasets.

## To Log In

Your dashboard and account management pages are all hosted at [manage.lodlab.com](http://manage.lodlab.com/).
To log in to your account, click on the `Log In` link at the top of the page. If you are currently logged in to your
GitHub account you will be automatically redirected back to the Linked Data Laboratory site with your account logged in.
If you are not currently logged in to your GitHub account you will be taken to the GitHub site and asked for your user name
and password. At no time is your GitHub password shared with our site - you simply log in on GitHub and we receive a token
from them that authenticates you as the logged in user.

## To Log Out

To log out from the management pages, simply click the `Log Off` link at the top of the page. Please note that this only 
logs you off from the Linked Data Laboratory - you will remain logged in to your GitHub user account.
