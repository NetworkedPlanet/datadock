DataDock uses GitHub accounts for all authorization, so to sign up for DataDock you simply need a GitHub account. If you already have a GitHub account simply hit the `SignUp` button, and then `Let's Go!`

If you do not already have a GitHub account you will be prompted to create one at this stage, or you can create one directly over on [GitHub](https://github.com/join/).

The first time you sign in to DataDock with your GitHub account you'll need to grant the DataDock application access to your account. We use this access to create and update data in your target repositories. 

After the granting access to the application, you will finally be asked to confirm that you agree to our 
[Terms of Service](http://manage.datadock.io/terms), which completes the Sign Up process.
